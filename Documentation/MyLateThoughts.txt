2.4 b1 why there needs to be a message sent already?
3 Making appointements: accept the other calendar should be possible
or link a calendar with the advertisement. Per Ad one calendar. Sync
later with private calendar (per user).
4.4 Precondition. User has performed a search before. I think that is
since you I can send you a link to something withouth the need of
searching it. I guess that is restricting the flow too much.
10.4 a2 again too much of a restriction. If you very much like sb's

him or her to your list of favourites.
Therefore I would really change the hole Main Scenario
