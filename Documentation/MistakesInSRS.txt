0a.6 - 4 User gets redirected to start page, now logged in.

0b.6 - 3
I saw at lucas Apple machine that after updating the profile no confirmation message was shown on new page (updatedProfile.jsp)

0c.6 does not work -> current password and reentering password !!!


0d.6 - 1 No confirmation is shown after logout

1a.8 Special Requirements
Displaying a list of 30 or less flats with thumbnails and text must not take more than 5 seconds.
Solche Zeitangaben sollten doch nicht mehr drinnen stehen oder?


1d.7 1d'' not consistent since nobody needs to be logged in. You always click on something existing.
	In my opinion we can delete the whole d'' Furthermore you can look at profiles without beeing looked in.

2a.5 no copy is saved but it is under send
2a.7 - 1 nothing happens... Subject has a * but message has no * indicating it is mandatory (although it is.)

2b.5 - 1 no copy is saved -> it's NOT under sent

3a.4 - 2 no real email is needed and if you refer to the username (email) then the first point being logged in is sufficent

3b.4 - 3 nice one but certainly no precondition ;)

3b.6 - 4 no notification is sent to user. The add is deleted though and gives visual feedback already...
