Meeting with the customer on the 8th of October 2014

Customer wants to give unregistered users the possibility to search
the DB for ads. If the user likes a flat s/he can pm the ad placer.
This allows a bigger range of user to use the page.

The ad placer suggests some dates on which s/he is free for visits.
This dates are public (also to unregistered users?). The customer
insists that the ad searcher needs to request a meeting and that the
ad placer needs to accept the request. The ad placer has clearly more
privileges.

When submitting the request, the ad searcher will have to fill in the
date and some other information?!. The customer mentioned a free text
field for a short letter, describing the person's motivation/background.
Let's put it into the prototype and check with customer again.

Ad searcher and ad placer have a possibility to look up all their dates.
Calendar would be nice.
