Customer liked the overall design of the page.

the place field in the header is used to rarely and should not be that prominent on the page.
The customer wants it hidden in account.

The messaging system it good and the system should be able to send emails. OK.

Andrea likes the myRooms page where you can see the ads placed and the bookmarked ads of
other people. Since the two options will rarely be used at the same time it is important
to dynamically hide the option where no entries are found in the DB.

The button for subscribing to alerts from a search is missing. After searching the DB
subscribing to such an filter should be possible.

Checkmarks should be added to the calendar so that the searcher may tick the dates he can
make it. The advertiser can see this selection and decide if it's ok or not.

If somebody looks at a house, the advertiser should be linked through his picture to his profile.
If many users have registered and all live in that house the advertiser should be able to add
them so as the searcher may click on any of them.
-> Andrea said it would be nice to see all of them as little thumbnails on the flat ad.
