#Team 1 - Questions for the customer (1.10.2014)#

##Questions based on the use cases


###As a user I want to place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment
* How much guidance do you expect? Should there just one big textfield for all the information or do you want separate textfields for the duration, cost, adress etc.?

###As a user I want to search for relevant ads in a specific area

* What is meant by area? Is this a city, a zip code, a region or a combination of those?

###As a user I want to get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)

###As a user I want to quickly send an enquiry to the ad placer

* How should these enquiries be sent? via E-Mail or via a messaging system within the platform?

###As an ad placer I want to conveniently manage enquiries and organize on-site visits

###As a user I want to manage scheduled visits
* Should the system warn you if it's not/hardly possible to visit several apartments in a row? (e.g. if you try to visit 2 apartments with a 5 minute break in between, however 5 minutes aren't enough for the travel distance)

###As an ad placer I want to compile a list of the most promising candidates
* Besides picking your favorite candidates yourself, should there be a possibility to let the system create a list? If yes, which would be the criteria to determine whether somebody is a promising candidate? 


###As a user I want to bookmark interesting ads

* Should there be a "favorite" function (the ad is saved in the profile of the user) or do you literally mean "bookmarking" as in the browser function bookmarking?

###As a user I want to subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads
* Which are the criteria for an ad to be considered relevant? The same as if you would search an apartment? (e.g. price, max. distance from zipcode x, ...)



## Aditional questions 

* What information should the user provide when signing up?
* Is the user identified by a nickname or by their real name?
* Should there be a function to report impostors? (e.g. if an advertiser asks for money before a visit)
