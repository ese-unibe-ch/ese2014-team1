#Team 1 - Questions for the customer (1.10.2014)#

##Questions based on the use cases


###As a user I want to place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment

* Is the platform *only* for *shared* apartments?
* What is a shared apartment? Everything with at least one flatmate?

###As a user I want to search for relevant ads in a specific area

* What is meant by area? Is this a city, a zip code, a region or a combination of those?
* What is meant by 'relevant' (see below)?
* You said users can place ads and search ads. Is there one user type for both functions or do you sign up explicitly only as one of them?
* If you can search and advert with the same account, how exactly do you want us to design the interfaces for both?

###As a user I want to get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)

* Exactly which properties do you want to list? (exact list)
* Same question for the roommate profile: Which information can roommates provide?
* Of the above mentioned properties: By which of those do you want to be able to search the database?
* Which of those informations are compulsory for an ad placer/roommate to give?
* Is there a minimum/maximum of pictures ad placers can/must upload?

###As a user I want to quickly send an enquiry to the ad placer

* How should these enquiries be sent? via E-Mail or via a messaging system within the platform?
* What information about you is given to the ad placer at that time? Only your real/nickname (see below), your full profile or something else?
* Can you also contact users which don't have an active ad placed?

###As an ad placer I want to conveniently manage enquiries and organize on-site visits

* What do you mean by 'conveniently manage' and 'organize'? Please give us a full list of the functionality you expect.

###As a user I want to manage scheduled visits

* If you enter a visit into your schedule, does the ad placer have to confirm it?
* What does the "schedule" form look like? Date, time, duration, and a comment field? Will there be a direct link to the flat in question?
* Should the system warn you if it's not/hardly possible to visit several apartments in a row? (e.g. far away locations within a short time)

###As an ad placer I want to compile a list of the most promising candidates

* Besides picking your favorite candidates yourself, should there be a possibility to let the system create a list? If yes, which would be the criteria to determine whether somebody is a promising candidate? 

###As a user I want to bookmark interesting ads

* Should there be a "favorite" function (the ad is saved in the profile of the user) or do you literally mean "bookmarking" as in the browser function bookmarking?
* Do you expect us to include social media interfaces, e.g. for 'sharing' a flat on Facebook etc.?

###As a user I want to subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads

* Which are the criteria for an ad to be considered relevant? The same as if you would search an apartment? (e.g. price, max. distance from zipcode x, ...)

## Additional questions 

* What information should the user provide when signing up?
* Is there some kind of identity verification mechanism, e.g. sending an actual letter to the user with some data to confirm online?
* Is the user identified by a nickname or by their real name?
* Do you also expect us implement some kind of "documents" function, where users can upload relevant data, like salary statements and other official documents? If so, what are the exact specifications, especially concerning visibility?
* What is a flat identified by? A name, or a number, or a thumbnail, or just the address? For example in the contexts of: showing a list of search results, showing a list of bookmarked flats, or showing a list of scheduled visits.
* Should there be a function to report impostors? (e.g. if an advertiser asks for money before a visit)
