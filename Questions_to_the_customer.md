#Team 1 - Questions for the customer (1.10.2014)#

##Questions based on the use cases


###As a user I want to place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment

* Is the platform *only* for *shared* apartments? _Also entire flats, like studios_
* What is a shared apartment? Everything with at least one flatmate?
* How much information do you want to share (***)

###As a user I want to search for relevant ads in a specific area

* What is meant by area? Is this a city, a zip code, a region or a combination of those? _Range around city (up to 20-40km). See other websites for examples (a max. distance from a zip-code)_

* What is meant by 'relevant' (see below)?
* You said users can place ads and search ads. Is there one user type for both functions or do you sign up explicitly only as one of them? _One type of account, one type of profile_
* If you can search and advert with the same account, how exactly do you want us to design the interfaces for both?
* Tracking, cookies? Sign up with Google to know even more?

###As a user I want to get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)

* Exactly which properties do you want to list? (exact list) _Blend immoscout.24 with wgzimmer.ch. List of the properties: As much information as possible on the location, the price, description of the room (good combination of text and images on wgzimmer), square footage, date of moving in (for a limited time or open-end), roommates (gender, age or even user profile), looking for a special candidate? (e.g. girl-apartment looking for girls only), animals, smokers, studios without roommates is optional_
* Same question for the roommate profile: Which information can roommates provide?
* Of the above mentioned properties: By which of those do you want to be able to search the database? _basic search at first: main criteria like wgzimmer.ch, and then additional filters and sorting orders (like immoscout24.ch). Since a good search is an important quality-identifier, additional things like "got washmachine?" are recommended_
* Which of those informations are compulsory for an ad placer/roommate to give? _roommate: picture and description of themselves_
* Is there a minimum/maximum of pictures ad placers can/must upload? _10 pictures at max, 0 at minimum_
* Should there be a minimal picture resolution/quality or are all sizes accepted?
* Do you want a link or a window showing it on google maps?

###As a user I want to quickly send an enquiry to the ad placer

* How should these enquiries be sent? via E-Mail or via a messaging system within the platform? _internal messaging system, notification via E-mail_
* What information about you is given to the ad placer at that time? Only your real/nickname (see below), your full profile or something else?
* Can you also contact users which don't have an active ad placed?

###As an ad placer I want to conveniently manage enquiries and organize on-site visits

* What do you mean by 'conveniently manage' and 'organize'? Please give us a full list of the functionality you expect. _like immoscout.24 (contact form) and then via the internal messaging_
* Do you want to be manageing it on the go? Mobile App required?

###As a user I want to manage scheduled visits

* If you enter a visit into your schedule, does the ad placer have to confirm it?
* What does the "schedule" form look like? Date, time, duration, and a comment field? Will there be a direct link to the flat in question?
* Should the system warn you if it's not/hardly possible to visit several apartments in a row? (e.g. far away locations within a short time)
* Do you want special extra interface (doodle like) _optional feature_

###As an ad placer I want to compile a list of the most promising candidates

* Besides picking your favorite candidates yourself, should there be a possibility to let the system create a list? If yes, which would be the criteria to determine whether somebody is a promising candidate? 
* What does the ad placer do with that list? Just display it once or save it for later? Or is there any other additional functionality concerning that list? _start with a large list (e.g. all that filled out the form) and you can then kick out those that you don't want. Ad-placer picks about 4, after the visits, he can make a ranking (annotating a list like a comment for the publisher of the ad)_
* Creation of webbased mailing lists for invitations (possibly with above mentioned special doodle interface?)

###As a user I want to bookmark interesting ads

* Should there be a "favorite" function (the ad is saved in the profile of the user) or do you literally mean "bookmarking" as in the browser function bookmarking?
* Do you expect us to include social media interfaces, e.g. for 'sharing' a flat on Facebook etc.? _no, is an optional feature_
* Send button for sending ads to your predefined email address

###As a user I want to subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads

* Which are the criteria for an ad to be considered relevant? The same as if you would search an apartment? (e.g. price, max. distance from zipcode x, ...) 
* How is the alert delivered to you? Email or a notification within the platform?
* Do you want direct syncing with your parship profile? Extended payable functionality only...

## Additional questions 

* What information should the user provide when signing up?
* Is there some kind of identity verification mechanism, e.g. sending an actual letter to the user with some data to confirm online?
* Is the user identified by a nickname or by their real name?
* Do you also expect us implement some kind of "documents" function, where users can upload relevant data, like salary statements and other official documents? If so, what are the exact specifications, especially concerning visibility?
* What is a flat identified by? A name, or a number, or a thumbnail, or just the address? For example in the contexts of: showing a list of search results, showing a list of bookmarked flats, or showing a list of scheduled visits. _pictures are very important! short sentence that describes the appartment/room in few words_
* Should there be a function to report impostors? (e.g. if an advertiser asks for money before a visit)
* Which features of the platform are available/visible to users who are not signed in?
* Do you want extra functionality like "casual searching" or "successometer"?
* Do you want a user friendly "Ratgeber" to tell you how to improve your changes? What the do's and dont's are...


## Additional stuff

* _Have a list of properties that are visible for an apartment at once: kitchen, washing machine.._
